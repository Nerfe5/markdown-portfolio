Hi how are things? I am Efr√©n, *I am an Electronics Engineer*, and I am currently introducing myself to the **world of web development**. I am very excited to be able to develop an _administration system for medical equipment breakdown reports_ and I will tell you nothing in a very long time.

Ok it's all bye
